    Engines declare their required metadata. ModernBERT needs device cu_seqlens
    (int32), max_seqlen and device positions; host_lengths is optional. Qwen may
    instead require host lengths. Construction never derives or validates tensor
    values. Callers own consistency and must not mutate metadata during a call.

    Positions preserve the original model's semantics; they are not implicitly
    reset. Empty sequences, arbitrary masks and nonstandard positions are not
    universally supported. Check the selected engine's contract.
